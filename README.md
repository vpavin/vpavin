I'm a passionate professional with experience in the most diverse areas of IT, from Java Enterprise to IoT, from Angular applications running on the cloud to the Linux system supporting the environment on the bare metal. Since the cloud became the new IT standard, I started working on legacy application modernization and native development. It also became a hobby, and Kubernetes may share the list among gaming and guitar playing.

Speaking of which, gaming, music, and technology are my favorite things when I'm not on my work laptop. If I need something that I didn't find, I develop or 3D print it.
